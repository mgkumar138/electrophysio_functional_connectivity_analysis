Functional Connectivity Analysis
by performing Correlation, Coherence, Granger Causality 

Code built for Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings analysis from multi channel electrodes

Aim: To use graph theory to understand local network circuitry

- perform pairwise correlation/coherence to create undirected graph and 
- Granger analysis to create directed graph
- to find common input/common source nodes and adaptive connections
